# Quick Start

## Launch terminal

Try Towhee in this page, plase click
<KatacodaBtn />

## Install Towhee
```console
pip install towhee
```
If you want to install Towhee with conda or from source code, see [this page](get-started/install) for more details.

## Try your first pipeline

For this quick start we are going to use an image embedding pipeline. 

```python
# Import pipeline from towhee, pipeline is the main function in towhee.
from towhee import pipeline

# Initiate the pipeline. Once the utility `pipeline()` is called, all necessary 
# `Pipeline` and `Operator` will be automatically downloaded from hub.towhee.io.
embedding_pipeline = pipeline('image-embedding')

# Run image through pipeline.
output = embedding_pipeline('towhee_logo.png')

# Print the output embedding.
print(output)
```

## Try more pipelines

We can try more pipelines by replacing the pipeline name, for example, a image embedding pipeline with ResNet101 encoder can be created via
```python
embedding_pipeline = pipeline('image-embedding-resnet101')
```
A summary of image embedding pipelines can be found at [this page](pipelines/image-embedding).
In addition, it is highly-recommended to browse the [hub](https://hub.towhee.io/pipelines) for more interesting pipelines.
