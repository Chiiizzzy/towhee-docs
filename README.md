## üëè Contributing

### Update docs
* All our documentation is generated from markdown files you can find in the `docs` directory. If the program is already running locally, everytime you change the file, you can visit `http://localhost:3000/docs/YOUR-DOCS-PAGE` to see your work.

* If you want to add a new doc or update order or label the docs appear in the sidebar, you can change header metadata (aka frontmatter) in the markdown or take a look at the `sidebars.json` file. 

* In most cases, you needn't use custom components in markdown, but you do, change the file extension from `md` to `mdx` so you can write JSX in markdown files and render them as React components easily. For more, please refer to https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react.
### Update website
Our doc website is a static site generated using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). Please make sure you have been familiar with it before contributing.
